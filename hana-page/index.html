          <h4>2034</h4>
          <h3>$69,000 sales</h3>
          <p class="blackbox"> Once upon a time in a quaint little village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a bright and inquisitive girl
          named Hana. From a very young age, Hana displayed an insatiable curiosity for the world around her. Her eyes sparkled
          with wonder as she observed the dance of fireflies in the warm summer nights and marveled at the intricacies of the
          stars above.  <a

              <h3>$91,000 sales</h3>
              <p class="blackbox">Hana's parents, who were both humble farmers, recognized her extraordinary intelligence and encouraged her thirst for
              knowledge. They had a modest library of books that Hana devoured eagerly, exploring worlds and ideas that expanded her
              young mind. She would often spend hours under the shade of the ancient oak tree, reading and dreaming.
</p>

                  <h4>2014</h4>
                  <h3>$55,000 sales</h3>
                  <p class="blackbox">As Hana grew older, her reputation as the village's smartest girl spread far and wide. She could solve complex math
                  problems that left even the adults baffled and had a deep understanding of nature, from the secrets of the forest to the
                  mysteries of the seasons. She was also known for her compassion and would help her fellow villagers with their problems,
                  offering sage advice and clever solutions.</p>


                      <h4>2004</h4>
                      <h3>$45,000 sales</h3>
                      <p class="blackbox">But no matter where her studies took her, Hana always remained humble and grounded, never forgetting her roots in the
                      little village. She returned home years later, not only as the smart girl named Hana but as a brilliant scholar who
                      continued to share her knowledge with her village, helping them prosper and thrive
                    Hana's story became legend in the village, a reminder that intelligence combined with humility and a love for one's
                    community could create a brighter future for all. And so, the legacy of the smart girl named Hana lived on, inspiring
                    generations to come to seek knowledge, embrace curiosity, and never forget where they came from.</p>
